# Work-Day-Scheduler-Week-5

## Description

This Project was designed as a homework assignment for OSU's Coding bootcamp hosted by Trilogy. 

A Work day Scheduler is created for the hours of 9am to 5pm. The main goal of the project is to be able to allow user input to populate in the description box and save it to the local storage for the described timeBlock. Once the local storage has data stored, make the data remain on the page after reload. 

This project has been deployed to GitHub Pages. To get this project up and running, you can follow the deployment link. Or, download the sources files to use this as a template.
